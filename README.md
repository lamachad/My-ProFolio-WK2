# My-ProFolio-WK2


This is my portfolio webpage that I made using both HTML and CSS. I used an extensive amount of differnt techniques to make my website both informative and visually apealling. I made use of the navigation bar to add anchor links to the differnt sections of my website as well as a link to my resume. I used differnt classes and id's to creat differnt containers within my webpage. I also made use of differnt reasources like the Fa Icons extensions which made adding differnt icons like Facebook and LinkedIn much easier. I added differnt hover effects in my project, specifically to the social media icons, the project contaner holders, and the navbar.
